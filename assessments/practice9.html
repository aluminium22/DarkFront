<h2>Practice week 8</h2>
<p>I put between 12-15 hours in this week</p>
    <ol>
    	<li>I read all that bit about float... Really helpful I guess, lots to learn</li>
       <li>I tried white a bit more to get me nav bar appropriately working. I also tried to do some artwork for custom buttons</li>
       <li>integrated the nav bar to all main pages. Also toyed around with absolute and fixed positions... fixed was annoying.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Examples</h3>
