    Style Guide: I will be using 111145, 161639, 080834, 1D1D61 and 222261 as the primary colors in my color scheme. I chose a monochromatic style for my website as opposed to a complementry, analogic or triad style simply to keep things more simplistic. I feel that my art work and the overall content of the website displays enough interest that I don't want to distract from it with too much going on in the background.
Objective 4: Please refer to "Deliberate Practice Week02 - Journal Entry" Page Two, for infor on Target Audience, Persona, Scenario etc.    </p>

    <h3>Site purpose</h3>
    <p>Have you been thirsting for a real story? One with morals and actual plot, art, colors strong character and mysticism? TV series and even comic book settings are so shallow and plot lines are over used. I want to prove to you that I have the story that will take the world, not by force, but with force. Voluntarily you'll be taken in but the story that I have developed will, without consent, take you to a new plain of thinking. It consists of a world with dark familiarity, where there is no sun, at least viewable to the inhabitants. It starts, yet is not bound to the story of two brothers that find themselves trying to survive in the harsh environments that a sunless world would produce as well as survive the other races of man that hunt them down. They must find way to overcome and survive together.
   If we can meet another time I would love to tell you all about the premise. </p>
