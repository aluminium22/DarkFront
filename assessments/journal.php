    <p>Sorry, this website is currently unavailable but will be coming soon!</p>
    <p>I work from 8:30-5:30 My lunch break is my only time to go to the gymn. </p>
    <p>I wake up at 5:00am 6:00am depending on assignments due and how much was done at night.</p>
    <p>Week ends I work my second job. with varying hours. And some nights throughout the week. The plan is to come home and put myself right to work.</p>
    <p>I will get home about 5:50pm I hope to put at least an hour a day towards the goal. Experience dictates it will take more. I will work to get done what I must so to move on to other courses.
    </p> 
    <p>then, seeing as how I am with my wife while doing this I will bounce my progress off her as well as my constituents here on the I-learn.</p>

    <h2>Journal post 4</h2>
    <p>I just want to be clear that I may not hae been entering my journals the most clearly as I just read I should have but I have been doing them each time!</p> 
    <p>There are a lot of things that I learned this week Syntax is critical to understand through language and comprehension of where the html will evolve.</p>
    <p>My understanding of semantics is the fact that we are writing entries and making an archive that must be communicated through numbers and concourses of computers that must process information more and more effectively. In order
    to make this better they have to develop better methods of semantics and our organization and listing in semantics when we write html can help.</p>
    <p>I worked specifically on arranging my website desgn.As you can see I learned and added a lot to the layout
    via css. I also worked on semantics and understanding syntax. The website itself should be demonstration of my work.
    there were many hours I spent working on this probably about 12-14 hours this week.</p>

    <p>Just a note. I wish I had known about lists earlier. I would have set this up that way</p>
    <p>Just to make it clear, I will list which pages were posted as my journal entries to try and organize it all</p>
