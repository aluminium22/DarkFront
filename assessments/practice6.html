<h2>Practice week 6</h2>
<p>I put between 12-15 hours in this week</p>
    <ol>
    	<li>I did not do much in "text markup"</li>
       <li>Tried my hand at an unordered list</li>
       <li>Enjoyed my time learning about tables and forms. Forms are very handy</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Video Attempt</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>This is the prologue scene 1</dt>
        <dd>
    <video controls preload="none" src="/assessments/vid/0001-0140.mp4">Watch</video>
        <dd>
        <dt>This is the second scene to the prologue</dt>
        <dd>
    <video controls preload="none" src="/assessments/vid/0001-0123.mp4">Watch</video>
    <p>Each of these videos I created in 3d. The art is mine, the work is mine, the animation is mine
    I created these as prologue shots for my web series I hope to start. Learning how to get these videos on here 
    was hard yet huge! The hard work pays off. I hope to use my knowledge of Adobe Flash to setup my 
    home page. It seems like flash is frowned upon, a bit, but I will make it simple and look nice.</p>
    <p>Can you figure out which I drew 2d and which I created 3 dimensionally?</p>
        </dd>
