<!-- This is going to be practice on the links and linking my css and potentially java script
so far I have just been putting it right in. A big no no.-->

        <p>I did not have the courage to take on the modularization of this week
        php is not the easiest scripting in my observation. I did read a lot about it
        and try to figure out how it works, honestly, I'm a little at a loss but
        I'll get there. there is so much to take in. I wish i could soak up and retain every
        last bit of all the readings. It may not look like much but it is a lot of work!
        The idea behind organizing your pages with the css and the javascript as linked  directories
        was an amazing thing to learn. I actually have a friend who showed me this very think
        and ever since he did I have always been wondering How I could pull this off myself. Well
        here I am reading and come to find out that it's really not that difficult. It makes things cleaner and
        it's easier the keep things consistent. I got very hung up on this detail and so obviously this
        is where my focus was on learning this week. I also enjoy learning about absolute links and relative links.
        This is also stuff I was very curious about the".." before finding the folder, very interesting 
        and who know I was using absolutes? It's good thing they are not frowned upon like the 
        way I was organizing. Entities was another I took time to read into. I saved it to my
        folder for later learning too. It's good to have those on hand I think. Great stuff to learn!</p>
