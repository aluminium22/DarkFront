<h2>Practice week 10</h2>
<p>I put between 11-12 hours in this week</p>
    <ol>
    	<li>This has truly been a lot to take in. I spent a lot of time on background images</li>
       <li>Once again without any fruit, I have tried to line my navbar up and failed. Spent way too much time there.</li>
       <li>I understand sprites pretty well also look into forms... hard to wrap my head around</li>
    </ol>
