    <h3>Deliberate Practice Week 02</h3>
    <h4>Journal Entry</h4>
    <br>
    <p>I learned a lot about html5 but I learned more about how to plan my web site
    It's not simply something you jump into! For example, I had no Idea that 
    I would have to be so specific in my labeling of web pages that I would need it 
    Real simple, yet at the same time, include enough words to make it traceable on the 
    world wide web!</p>
    <p>I also learned much about layouts, enough I wanted to try my own.</p>

    <p>simple but hopefully headed the right direction</p>
    <br>
    <p>Yet another thing I was working on was was the audience Identification</p>

    <p>Above and beyond it all. I want to have more time working on the html. I am far from fully understanding it.
    I am sure there will be opportunity in the course to further that learning, I hunger for it now though.</p>
