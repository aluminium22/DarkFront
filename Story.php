    <h1>Story</h1>
    <dl>
	<h3>Episode 1</h3>
    	<dt>Introduction: Storyboard, sets dark-dwellers up as being the bad guys. </dt>
        <dd>Disciple Jovan narrating the introduction “cautionary tale about dark dwellers”. As intro finishes, camera focuses on Uccide who is sitting in watching disciple talk to group of warriors, fire burning in his eyes. 

Dialogue between Jovan and Uccide, Jovan suspects Uccide is not what he says he is, pressures Uccide into paying extra “tithes”. 

Uccide heads toward duel, challenger looks formidable, Uccide calmy avoids blows, then strikes fatal blow to chest, establishes dominance, then brutally finishes off opponent. 

Dialogue/Narrative

Uccide heads for dark-ride, heads out to hunting party. Party questions motives on leaving. Uccide is disgusted, says something to effect “while those dark dwellers are out there slaying our own, you want to sit here and party or whatever?” (kicks questioner out of party), leaves, followed by rest of party. 

Heads out into dark with his party, hears sounds, tells party to prepare to fight, hints of battle with darken wolves, camera pans wide, shows Sun & Radiant watching the fight unfold. Uccide hears noise, turns and illuminates spot where Sun & Radiant were sitting, spot is empty. Uccide pulls his weapon and charges into the fray.

End scene!

       <h3>Episode 2</h3>
    	<dt>script</dt>
        <dd>Scene 1: Overlooking the vast ravine in the darken-realm, Sun perched upon cliff, very near edge gazing downward. Mild breeze. Camera behind Sun. Sun silhouetted by broken moon. Side profile, cowl billowing in the wind. 
Narration: They’re out there... there can’t be many, but it doesn’t matter, somehow it just doesn’t matter. 

Scene 2: Quick motion, Sun leans over edge in crouching stance (cat/creature like). Cape still billowing in wind, leans threateningly off edge of cliff. After a moment of gazing downwards in crouched stance, he plunges into the darkness.
Narration: Cold as the air, darker than day, yet they strike in the night. The moon is their minion, and nothing is their master.

Scene 3: Profile shot from distance of Sun jumping down, Fast/Slow/Fast scene, slow over the moon w/silhouette. Continues in rapid succession of shots.
Narration: If they had wings, I’d believe they could fly. If they didn’t kill I’d believe they didn’t exist. Among the wolves that we hunt and the light that we bring, they’re the dark dwellers.

Scene 4: Camera follow shot, camera falls down cliff ahead of Sun, from initial camera angle of scene one. Follows rapidly down cliff face, passes Sun’s rapid descent Arrives at Light Dwellers at the base of the cliff. Three quick angles/shots of unsuspecting light dwellers/character presentation. Holding torches (lots of light). 

Scene 5: Sun flaring for the strike, silhouetted by the moon, catlike grace, (partial slow motion) FSF shot, stabbing light dweller through the back with sint, protrudes from the front.
Narration: They murder.

Scene 6: After Sun’s descent full force of the blow is placed in the Sint, which gorily explodes out of the LD’s chest. Guard drops torch/weapon. Sinks to ground gurgling/groaning (slowish).
Narration: Sun whispers “Die” -Narrator:  They slay our men without hesitance, and evade our every move to pacify.

Scene 7: Hooded figure standing once again before the moon, cloak billowing, body completely still, Sint embedded in slain foe (bloody). To the left and foreground of the camera are the other two surprised but not frightened LDs. 
Narration: No mercy, we must stop them, we have to.

Scene 8: Distance shot, same arrangement. Shadowed figure passes in the foreground quickly. To the right base of cliff visible. To the left and in the background is the scene with Sun & Light Dwellers before the smaller moon.
Narration: We only ever see one, but the shadows aid them.</dd>
