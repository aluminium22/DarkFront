	<h3>Sun</h3>
    	<dt>Description</dt>
        <dd>Pale skin, light blue iris (almost white colored), large eyes that have the ability to pierce the Dark lands thick void,  black hair.  Slim muscular build with taunt quick reflexes.  Naturally stealthy, innately quick and tried by entire life of living in the Dark lands.
            </dd>


<dt>Height: 6’1”</dt>
<dt>Weight: 184 LBS</dt>
<dt>Age:26</dt>

	<dd>Brief History: born among a people with very little social structure. Parents were both killed at different points in his early childhood (though seemingly longer than most) both victims of the Light Dwellers hunting raids (not always common to have both parents slain by the Light Dwellers. It’s typical in their culture to die young, however, Darken beasts and elements are the typical killers. Once both parents were dead (Mother dead when he was three and father when he was eight) he grew up relying heavily on his older brother Radiant for support and education of survival. The two of them grew very close and even among the minimal social order of Dark Dwellers gained some recognition for the skills of self preservation that slowly turned to preservation of their race. While in their later teenage years The two brothers decidedly began setting up a silent method of hunting down the Light Dwellers (while on their hunts) and slaying few at a time. This was a difficult and unlikely task (The light Dwellers were physically much more empowered, their weakness, the dark.)

       <h3>Radiant</h3>
    	<dt>Description</dt>
        <dd>Pale with large dark blue eyes. Riddled with scars, sarcastic, cynical and very protective of his younger brother. A driven man. Great natural talent to fight. somewhat stocky bulky small muscular build.
Black hair.</dd>

<dt>Height: 6’</dt>
<dt>Weight: 200 LBS</dt>
<dt>Age:28</dt>
<dt>Brief History:</dt>
        <dd> Obviously much of the history is shared with Sun. Radiant always became bitter towards the Light Dwellers and their ruthless method of hunting and killing the Dark Dwellers. With much practice in trapping and Radiant’s reckless nature. He would constantly seek out Darken beasts in his youth to hunt and slay. He never always came out unbattered but he gained skills in fighting like few others, until he tutored his brother in a like manner. Many times, when old enough, Radiant would bring Sun with him to hunt the Darken beast and together they became a powerful couple. Obviously they could not stand a chance to the larger Darken beasts, though, living so deep within the Dark land they encountered the likes the the Light Dwellers could only dream of finding on a hunt. (The light that the Light Dwellers brought with them, to ensure sight. Would scare the experienced and larger darken beasts further into the darkness while the younger Darken beasts would wander out and become victim. The Light Dwellers really had no idea what monsters lay in wait beyond their feeble torches) Radiant and Sun socially had a lot of experience with other Dark Dwellers due to their encounters early on, first with a large roving colony that their father had found and again with a family they had found together in Radiant’s mid teens. Radiant and Sun had broken from the family (one mother and her three children two boys and one girl - Radiant’s age) They had left the family when they(the mother and daughter) had been killed by a light dweller hunting party. This was a devastating encounter in which Radiant killed his first man (Light Dweller) The devastation was too much due to the fact that the mother and the daughter (Luce) his age had been brutally tortured by having her eyelids cut and a torch slowly forced to her face. Radiant and Sun as well as the brothers of Luce were returning from a hunt in the Dark lands just as the Light Hunting party was leaving the carnage. There was not much any of them could do, but Radiant fast enough- even without a darken steed- wanted revenge. In a rage he left his brother and others to catch up to the hunting party. He reached and rather difficulty separated and killed one of the party members. Before killing the man he extracted the name of the Light Dweller’s party leader -uccide- The man in charge of killing his love, from that point he dedicated his life to being a master at killing. After his encounter with the Light Dweller he had sustained such injuries he passed out and was only preserved by his brother who found him in the Dark lands bleeding out, unconscious and undoubtedly attracting Darken creatures to the scent of blood.

   <h3>Uccide</h3>
    	<dt>Description</dt>
Dark skinned (as most Light dwellers,  though a little more fair than some.) Iris of a deep deep brown. Bulky, broad shouldered and very quick for his size. Ranks at average in height for his people. Teeth worn are quite a few. Mainly consisting of Dark Dwellers. Specializes in hand to hand combat, However he is known for his ego (even among Light Dwellers) and is not afraid to take a cheap shot if it does not degrade his reputation.<br>

<dt>Height: 7’6”</dt>
<dt>Weight: 320 LBS</dt>
<dt>Age:50</dt> 
<dt>Brief history:</dt>
<dd> Uccide always aspiring to on top in his society. Mother was a cleric (could still be) and his father was slain in a hand to hand brawl when he was 18. Uccide’s own father had issued the duel and dictated the terms of engagement. Typically none could beat Uccide’s father in hand to hand combat however, that day was different. Uccide found the man who had killed his father and the next day he strode into this man’s courtsquare, where everyone was to witness and armed with seven revolvers he killed four of this man’s followers without a warning and injured three in a fray. His plan to provoke the man had prevailed as it put them both in a face to face fight that quickly ended with the man that killed Uccide’s father on top of Uccide choking the life out of him. Due to the complex structure of their politics this could end good either way for Uccide. For a “better fighter” to kill without first issuing a duel would be viewed as wrong, no matter how many of this man’s men he killed. So dying was a winning option, however plan A is how the story unfolded. As the struggle continued Uccide managed to scrape through the greater warriors with a arrow stone that had dowsed a Malshroom poison, it was not one that would take effect immediately, but that is what Uccide wanted. Uccide managed to choke words out about everyone watching, and how is reputation was going to look if Uccide was killed right there in the square. Uccide had a small moment of panic as he realized the man may not care and that it would be plan B after all. At the last moment the Light Dweller disengaged and issued the formal duel, for the morning. This was a little sooner than what Uccide had expected. However, in the end the poison did its job and successfully made Uccide look like he had defeated one of the greater Light warlords that there were in the city Orgo. The terms of engagement had been hand to hand and it was close. The result was all the followers of this man now followed Uccide. 
	On a hunting trip in which Uccide arranged particularly to make a strike on a discovered (small) gathering of Dark Dwellers. The strike went horribly wrong as the raid was blown by a small pack of Darkoons (three) crossed their path in route. The casualties were massive and there were few of Uccide’s men left. When they recovered somewhat from the attack they then were found by the Dark Dwellers that were very hesitant in the encounter. Uccide ordered an attack, even in their battered state and was surprisingly easily decimated. Uccide came head on with the seeming chief of the Dark Dwellers. He seemed to be holding back in his efforts and yet Uccide, who considered himself a more than adapt warrior was having a hard time keeping up with the Dark Dwellers swift moves. The “creatures” made hesitant but quick work of the other Light Dwellers and stood back as the leader and Uccide were fighting. In short, Uccide was being toyed with and it was clear by the quick and precise strikes from the Dark Dweller that Uccide was out skilled... It was the biggest blow to the biggest ego that the Light Dwellers had ever known. Eventually, because Uccide would not yield out of arrogance, the dark Dweller was forced to down him with a few quick strikes that knocked him to the ground. Winded, Uccide was left flat on his back with few burning torches laying about him from his fallen comrades. The Dark Dwellers silently stared then left him there, in the Dark Lands. He gathered all the teeth from his fallen men (not protocol or honorable if not his kills) and when he returned to the city (close by) he claimed they were Dark Dweller teeth and that he slew scores, and he was the lone survivor. He then recieved his title as Uccide the Dark Bane.
