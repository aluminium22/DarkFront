  <ol>
      <li> Lift your head only as high as necessary. 
          In calm bodies of water, like a lake or river, 
          lift just your eyes out of the water.</li>
      <li>In wavy ocean conditions, time it so you’re sighting on the top of a
          wave for the best view of the course.
          Feel your body rise and fall on the swells a
          nd sight accordingly.</li>
      <li>When conditions are choppy and unpredictable, 
          lift your head extra high but try to minimize the total number of times you sight. 
          Use landmarks and other swimmers when breathing to the side.</li>
      <li>Do not breathe while looking forward. Separate the two actions by sighting
          forward and then immediately rolling 
          your head to take a breath to the side.</li>
      <li>As you prepare to sight, press down with your 
          hand and arm during the catch phase of your stroke.
          This will slightly lift your upper body and make 
          it easier to raise your head.</li>
      <li>Arch your back while lifting your head. 
          This will allow your legs and feet to stay near the surface, 
          minimizing drag under the water.</li>
      <li>Kick extra hard for a moment while you are sighting. 
          This will help maintain forward 
          speed and also keep your feet from dropping.</li>
      <li> Sight 2–3 times in a row (during every other stroke). 
          Use the first sight to locate the buoy, the second sight to adjust 
          your angle and the third to verify your direction. 
          Swim straight for 20–30 seconds before repeating this system.</li>
      <li>Practice, practice, practice!
          Make a point to practice sighting drills in every second or third workout.</li>
