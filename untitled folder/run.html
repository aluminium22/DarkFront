  <h2> Run </h2>
  <h3>The total length to be ran 16 miles</h3>
  <p>This week’s workout comes from USAT Level I coach Maria Simone of No Limits Endurance. “This workout is a good way to keep some higher intensity work in your off-season routine, and can be included every other week or every 3 weeks,” Simone says. “While many of us will spend most of our time in aerobic training this time of year, small doses of threshold and suprathreshold training can provide benefit as well.”</p>
  <p>Simone says the intensity work for the interval portions should hover right around threshold heart rate or pace. Each interval gets slightly harder, but it also gets slightly shorter. For example, you can add an additional six-minute interval to the beginning and/or add a few more one-minute max efforts at the end of the workout.</p>

 This week’s bike workout comes from exercise physiologist, clinical/registered dietitian and USAT Level I coach Marni Sumbal of Trimarni Coaching and Nutrition in Jacksonville, Fla. Like her first trainer workout from November, Sumbal says the goal of this workout is to raise your lactic threshold in order to produce more power — without expending extra energy — so that ultimately you can run strong with good form off the bike.
